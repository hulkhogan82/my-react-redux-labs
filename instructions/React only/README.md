# Instructions and Labs for the 3-day React course

You've found the instructions for React, not to be confused with [React Native](https://github.com/rapPayne/react-redux-labs/tree/master/instructions/React%20Native) or [React with Redux](https://github.com/rapPayne/react-redux-labs/tree/master/instructions/React&#32;with&#32;Redux).

If you don't see any lab instructions here, don't panic. They will be loaded on an as-needed basis as the course progresses.

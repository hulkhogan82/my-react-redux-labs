# Instructions and Labs for React and Redux course

You've found the instructions for React with Redux, not to be confused with [React](https://github.com/rapPayne/react-redux-labs/tree/master/instructions/React%20Only) or [React Native](https://github.com/rapPayne/react-redux-labs/tree/master/instructions/React%20Native).

If you don't see any lab instructions here, don't panic. They will be loaded on an as-needed basis as the course progresses.
